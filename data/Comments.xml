I'm sure there are ways to do it, and it sounds like you have some ideas, but Plutus and Cardano SCs are so new that there isn't precedence. You can look at projects on Ethereum which have multiple versions. I think many of them just started from scratch with subsequent versions though. My advice would be to create the minimum version of your contract, even if it won't make it to production, and that will give you a much better idea of what options you have for upgrading."
